I stayed at an apartment in New York City while taking a developer Bootcamp called [App Academy](www.appacademy.io) over this past summer.

At first, the internet connection was fine. It would go out for a few seconds every hour but nothing more than that. After a few weeks, the internet started going out for hours at a time. During those hours, I would pack up and head to a cafe to work.

Our cable provider was a company called [Spectrum](www.spectrum.com). The owner of the apartment had initially had a different internet provider, but Spectrum had bought that company and was now the company who bills them every month.

We were paying about $100 dollars a month for TV and Cable from Spectrum. What was perplexing was that the TV never seemed to lose cable connectivity. The internet on the other hand, was getting progressively worse.

The First Call

The first time I called it took about half hour. The lady I talked to was able to do remote testing of our internet connection, and was confident that we were having internet piped into our apartment. She was not sure why I was experiencing issues, but was happy to schedule an appointment with a technician. I scheduled one of those, "sometime between 8AM and 2PM" appointments.

The Second Call

During a time which the internet was temporarily back on, I received a call from a guy in a call center in India. I know that because I asked him where he was. He let me know that the problem was likely fixed if I had internet again and I was happy to agree.

Of course, the problem was not fixed. At the time I was spending 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM staring at a computer at App Academy. After that, I would rather code at a Starbucks rather than alone in my apartment. After staring at a computer for 12 hours during the day I was unlikely to notice internet not working because I was rarely home and when I was home I was asleep.

The Third Call

After growing more frustrated after seeing a bill for 100 some odd dollars from Spectrum that month and realizing the internet was still not working, I scheduled another appointment. I was clear that the problem was never fixed and an appointment was reluctantly scheduled by the other party.

After getting another "sometime between 8AM and 2PM" appointment, the technician showed up. He almost immediately let me know that the problem was likely the splitter. We plugged in a new splitter, drank a club soda together, and internet was restored. He let me know that splitters are made for about five cents in China, and can break anytime. No one has to bump it or knock it, the device is just a cheap piece of metal and wiring that can stop working unexplainably.

What Exactly Caused the Problem

Here is how most cable and internet works. You have a cable company. They have a pipe that goes from their building (which is full of TV and internet consecutiveness) in your town right to your house. You give them money every month not to turn off your pipe. If you have a TV (for cable) and a modem (for internet) you likely have a splitter that basically takes one input wire (the telecom company's wire) and spits out two output wires (one for modem and one for cable). If that splitter is broken, either both TV and internet wont work or one or the other won't work.

The Forth Call

I called to cancel cable to cut our internet bill in half. I was transferred to Spectrum’s "Try persuade them to not cancel and up-sell them on the new and exciting cable-internet-phone package". I was told I would have to go to Spectrum’s store near W 96th St. to complete the transaction and not get billed for a $200 piece of hardware.

The Final Countdown

I biked twenty blocks to return our Cable box to half our bill. Once at the store I took a ticket like I was at a deli, waited twenty minutes, and was finally called to a kiosk by name. I returned the box (accidentally also providing our TV’s power cord which I never saw again). I asked to speak to a manager regarding possibly being refunded for two months of shitty internet with old broken splitter in hand. I was told I wouldn’t get a refund or voucher because I didn’t "complain enough." I asked what other course of action I had. None. No one at Spectrum exists to talk to aside from the workers in the store. I wasn't going to spend any more time dealing with the cable company or go to the BBB. All you can do is hope you never have to interact with them.

Cable Companies Can Really Act Like the Devil Sometimes

Four calls, two appointments, one broken piece of Spectrum hardware in hand which caused the problem. I didn’t complain enough. Hence this blog...
