description: "Cable company being a jerk story"

I stayed an apartment that my parents manage in New York City while taking a developer Bootcamp called ([App Academy](www.appacademy.io)).

At first, the internet connection was fine. It would go out for a few seconds every hour but nothing more than that. After a few weeks, the internet started going out for hours at a time. During those hours, I would pack up and head to a cafe to work.

Our cable provider was a company called ([Spectrum](www.spectrum.com)). My parents had initially had a different internet provider, but Spectrum had bought that company and was now the company who bills them every month.

We were paying about $100 dollars a month for TV and Cable from Spectrum. What was perplexing was that the TV never seemed to lose cable connectivity. The internet on the other hand, was getting progressively worse.

The First Call

The first time I called took about half hour. The lady I talked to was able to do remote testing of our internet connection, and was confident that we were having internet piped into our apartment. She was not sure why I was experiencing issues, but was happy to schedule an appointment with a technician. I scheduled one of those, "sometime between 8AM and 2PM" appointments.

The Second Call

During a time which the internet was temporarily back on, I received a call from a guy in a call center in India. I know that because I asked him where he was. He let me know that problem was probably fixed if I had internet again and I was happy to agree.

Of course, the problem was not fixed. At the time I was spending 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM staring at a computer at App Academy and really did not need internet at home. I would rather code at a Starbucks rather than alone in my apartment anyway. After staring at a computer for 12 hours during the day I was unlikely to try stream anything that would be interrupted by internet outage.

The Third Call

After growing more frustrated after seeing a bill for $100 some odd dollars from Spectrum that month, I scheduled another appointment. I was clear that the problem was never fixed and an appointment was reluctantly scheduled by the other party.

After getting another "sometime between 8AM and 2PM" appointment, the technician showed up. He almost immediately let me know that the problem was likely the splitter. We plugged in a new splitter, drank club sodas, and internet was restored. He let me know that splitters are made for about five cents in China, and can break anytime really. No one has to bump it or knock it, the device is just a cheap piece of metal and wiring that stop working unexplainably sometimes.

The Forth Call

I called to cancel Cable to cut our internet bill in half. I was transferred to Spectrum’s "Try not persuade them to cancel and up-sell them new and exciting cable-internet-phone package". Just a great conversation with Spectrum, "But how are you going to watch TV?". I was told I would have to go to Spectrum’s store near W 96th St. to complete the transaction and not get billed for a $200 piece of hardware.

The Final Countdown

I biked twenty blocks to return our Cable box to half our bill. Once at the store I took a ticket like I was at a deli, waited twenty minutes, and was finally called to a kiosk by name. I returned the box (accidentally also providing our TV’s power cord which i never saw again). I asked to speak to a manager regarding possibly being refunded for two months of shitty internet with old broken splitter in hand. I was told I wouldn’t get a refund or voucher because I didn’t "complain enough." I asked what other course of action I had. None. I wasn't going to spend any more time dealing with cable companies or going to the BBB. All you can do is hope you never have to interact with them aside from sending them money every month.

Cable Companies Can Really Act Like the Devil Sometimes

Four calls, two appointments, one broken piece of Spectrum hardware in hand which caused the problem. I didn’t complain enough.
