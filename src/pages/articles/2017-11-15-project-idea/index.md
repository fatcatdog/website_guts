description: "Analyzing all of those “Thank you for applying” emails and looking at them with D3.js"

During my short career, I estimate I’ve already sent out a thousand or so job applications. Recently I was walked through a D3.js tutorial, and think it would be pretty cool to do a data visualization using D3.js and all of those “Thank you for applying” emails.

Since college, I’ve been hired by four different companies. A family friend allowed me to work as an office assistant in his office for a summer. I was hired by ZocDoc through a Facebook friend of my brother’s Facebook post. I was then hired by Apttus by applying directly through the company website. Recently, I was hired off of a LinkedIn post.

In my next post I will detail how I:

-Download and organize all of my Gmail emails

-Try recover my Gmail emails from an email I used to use but now only have access through an old Android phone because I forgot my password…

-Convert all of those email into useable data

-Gain insights from that data

-Visualize that data with D3.js
