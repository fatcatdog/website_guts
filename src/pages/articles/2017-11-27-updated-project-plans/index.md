<strong>Any Kind of Tech Stack Mentality</strong>

I’ve been thinking more about my plan to build a carpooling service in React-Native. Realistically, I lack the skills and the time to accomplish that feat. I would need to quit my job and spend at least a year to become a good enough dev to accomplish that feat. Also, being a great React-Native dev isn’t really a goal I have. I just thought the language/framework was sexy and I would be willing to pour time into learning it.

But i gotta say. I am still excited about the prospect of building a carpooling app using my web-dev skills (the little I have).

I recently spent the weekend at my parents and I had to answer numerous, “What are you up to nowadays?” questions from friends and family. I have to admit, I told one person, I am building a carpooling service [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). I think that was the highlight of my weekend and I’m excited about that.

<strong>New Project Goal: Release an MVP</strong>

I am going to build a carpooling app using [Roman Pushkin](https://twitter.com/romanpushkin)’s [LibreTaxi](http://libretaxi.org/)’s open source platform. I am going to use his platform, customize it for Boston purposes, apply my custom plans as described in my previous article (offer non-money payment options), and shove it into the wild.

<strong>Updates on Discussions about Cars and My Project Plans</strong>

-My parents encouraged me to buy a used car or poor money into the lemon they have sitting in their driveway (I still don’t see it as a cost-effective-convenient option with biking, Ubering, and public transport being options).

-No one cares that you want to build an app. The few experienced developers I talked to, encouraged me to build a less sophisticated app to learn React which really isn’t the end goal of this project. I think those discussions helped me come to this conclusion. I think the goal of this project is to get experience launching an MVP.

-In my three hour car ride from Connecticut to Boston, I brought up I was resisting buying a car (money, convenience, and not wanting a car being the reasons). I explained in my ideal world cities would simply ban non-commercial cars from cities to then pour money into public-transport and bicycling infrastructure. I was told it would never happen in America, and it should never happen in the US, because, “owning a car is freedom”. I knew a lot of people hated waiting for bicyclists to pedal around them. But i didn't know people living in major American cities bought cars to improve their freedom. I am going to read further into [Vision Zero in New York City](https://www.transalt.org/getinvolved/vision-zero-now/platform) to find more information about asking people to sacrifice some of their car rights in the name of the greater good.
